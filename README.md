Pattern matching library for CoffeeScript.

This library is intended for use mainly when working on interpreters that execute or evaluate abstract syntax trees generated by parsers.

Initially conceived as part of the [lambda project](https://github.com/curran/lambda), a Lambda Calculus interpreter using PEG.js, CoffeeScript, and Underscore.
